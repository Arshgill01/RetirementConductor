# Evidence ledger

This ledger connects product claims to inspected runtime evidence. It is not a
test-output dump. Raw or sensitive artifacts remain ignored and are referenced
only by safe digest.

## Evidence modes

| Mode | Meaning | May satisfy live acceptance |
|---|---|---|
| `live` | Observed against the named running source or native tool | yes, within recorded scope |
| `fixture` | Produced from controlled deterministic test data | no |
| `replay` | Reproduced from a prior captured artifact | no |
| `analysis` | Source-backed reasoning without a runtime claim | no |

Every entry must name its commit, command or operator action, source versions,
artifact or digest, result, limitations, and the claim it supports.

## Baseline evidence

These observations came from the preceding experiment. They justify the build
but do not complete a product phase.

| ID | Mode | Claim | Evidence reference | Status | Limitation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EB-001 | live | DataHub expanded one repository consumer to 35 graph consumers | `docs/EVIDENCE_BASELINE.md` and experiment commit `a251cb7` | accepted baseline | not executed by this product |
| EB-002 | live | graph context changed the decision from allow to refuse | `docs/EVIDENCE_BASELINE.md` and experiment commit `a251cb7` | accepted baseline | policy was experiment code |
| EB-003 | live | one dbt consumer changed and passed native tests with stale-source refusal | `docs/EVIDENCE_BASELINE.md` and experiment commit `a251cb7` | accepted baseline | no durable campaign runtime |
| EB-004 | live | a stable refusal summary was written to and read back from DataHub | `docs/EVIDENCE_BASELINE.md` and experiment commit `7ef9f58` | accepted baseline | no complete producer gate |
| EB-005 | fixture | bounded Looker lifecycle fails closed in a deterministic boundary | `docs/EVIDENCE_BASELINE.md` and experiment commit `b5233ca` | accepted baseline | not live Looker evidence |

## Product phase evidence

Replace `not-run` only after the named phase acceptance commands have run and
the produced artifacts have been inspected.

| ID | Phase | Required mode | Tested commit | Evidence | Status | Limitations |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| EP-000 | 00 | fixture | not-run | executable contracts, fixtures, and repository checks | not-run | none recorded |
| EP-001 | 01 | fixture | not-run | state, replay, interruption, and policy evidence | not-run | none recorded |
| EP-002 | 02 | live | not-run | DataHub identity, pagination, envelope, and write/read-back | not-run | none recorded |
| EP-003 | 03 | live | not-run | Git/dbt plan, apply, validation, rollback, and receipt | not-run | none recorded |
| EP-004 | 04 | live and fixture | not-run | reconciliation, late-consumer refusal, publication, and gate | not-run | none recorded |
| EP-005 | 05 | live and fixture | not-run | canonical CLI/report parity, accessibility, and redaction | not-run | none recorded |
| EP-006 | 06 | live | not-run | Looker identity, apply, validation, compensation, and reconciliation | not-run | disposable access required |
| EP-007 | 07 | live and fixture | not-run | threat, fault, recovery, concurrency, and scan evidence | not-run | none recorded |
| EP-008 | 08 | live and operator | not-run | clean install, upgrade, reference run, and independent operation | not-run | independent operator required |

## Entry completion checklist

For each completed row, add a short section below the table with:

```text
Evidence ID:
Requirement IDs:
Repository commit:
Captured at:
Mode:
Source and tool versions:
Command or operator action:
Expected result:
Observed result:
Refusal cases:
Tracked artifact paths:
Private artifact digests:
What this proves:
What this does not prove:
Reviewer inspection:
```

An exit code without inspected output is insufficient. A tracked artifact
containing secrets or private evidence invalidates the entry until it is
removed safely and credentials are rotated where necessary.
